        <P>
          <strong>What just happened?</strong>
          <br /> The email you just opened and followed a link from was in fact
          a simulated phishing attack.
        </P>
        <P>
          Donâ€™t worry, no details you entered were recorded. However, if this
          was a real attack, you may have just handed sensitive information to a
          criminal which could have allowed them to access your personal
          information.
        </P>
        <P>
          Remember, whenever you receive an email you
          <strong> weren't expecting</strong>, ask yourself three questions:
        </P>
        <BulletListContainer>
          <BulletList>
            <li>
              Does it ask me to<strong> break policy</strong>?
            </li>
            <li>
              Does it convey an<strong> undue sense of urgency</strong>?
            </li>
            <li>
              Does it include a
              <strong> link or attachment I don't recognize</strong>?
            </li>
          </BulletList>
        </BulletListContainer>
      </ContentWrapper>
    </Container>
  );
